    <br>
    <p>Deadpool is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer
        <b>Fabian Nicieza and artist/writer Rob Liefeld</b>, the character first appeared in The New Mutants #98
        (cover-dated February 1991). Initially Deadpool was depicted <i>as a supervillain when he made his first
            appearance in The New Mutants</i> and later in issues of X-Force, but later evolved into his more
        recognizable antiheroic persona. Deadpool, whose real name is Wade Winston Wilson, is a disfigured mercenary
        with the superhuman ability of an accelerated healing factor and physical prowess. The character is known as the
        "Merc with a Mouth" because of his tendency to talk and joke constantly, including breaking the fourth wall for
        humorous effect and running gags.</p>
